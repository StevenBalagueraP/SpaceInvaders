The game works as follows:

Instances are created in the StartGame class, and then everything functions within the Bullet class, passing StartGame as a parameter to access the attributes of its subclasses. The diagram provides a better visualization.

Implemented Features:
Alien ships do not need to move.
Only the displayed ships and the protection block are necessary.
The player must be able to move and shoot.
The score will be updated each time a ship is destroyed. The score will be stored in memory while the game is running, but it will be lost when the application closes.
The protection block must be destructible by the player.
Every possible action must trigger a corresponding sound.
There must be a Start Screen with the described elements.
The game ends when the player reaches 500 points. (There may be waves of enemies.)
